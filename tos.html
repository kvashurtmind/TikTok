        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date: June 25, 2025</strong></p>
        <p>Welcome to Vibes Videos ("Service"), a platform that enables automated content posting to TikTok from Telegram channels. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with these Terms, you must not use the Service.</p>
        <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you are at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and agree to comply with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations, including the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/terms-of-service" target="_blank">TikTok Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines" target="_blank">TikTok Community Guidelines</a>.</p>
        <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
        <p>The Service is a bot that automatically collects content from designated Telegram channels and posts it to your TikTok account using the TikTok API. You authorize the Service to access your TikTok account via OAuth 2.0 to upload and publish content on your behalf. The Service operates at regular intervals as configured and requires your consent for all actions performed.</p>
        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>You are responsible for:</p>

        <p>We are not responsible for the content you choose to post or for any violations of TikTok’s policies resulting from your actions.</p>
        <h2>4. Account Authorization</h2>
        <p>To use the Service, you must authorize access to your TikTok account via OAuth 2.0. This allows the Service to upload and publish content on your behalf. You may revoke this authorization at any time through your TikTok account settings, which will terminate the Service’s ability to post on your behalf.</p>
        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>You retain ownership of the content you provide to the Service. By using the Service, you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use, reproduce, and distribute your content solely for the purpose of posting it to TikTok as authorized. We claim no ownership over your content.</p>
        <p>The Service, including its code, design, and branding, is protected by intellectual property laws and is owned by us or our licensors. You may not copy, modify, or distribute any part of the Service without permission.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Use the Service to post content that is illegal, defamatory, obscene, or violates any third-party rights.</li>
            <li>Attempt to interfere with, disrupt, or reverse-engineer the Service.</li>
            <li>Use the Service to impersonate others or misrepresent your identity.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Service for any violation of these Terms.</p>

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, and shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use or inability to use the Service, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</p>
        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to the Service or other users. You may also discontinue using the Service at any time by revoking authorization through TikTok or contacting us.</p>
        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. The updated Terms will be posted on this page with a revised effective date. Your continued use of the Service constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
